Recharge: 5.09% (6,341 failed of 124,651 total)\n2. P2P: 4.96% (5,574 failed of 112,445 total)\n\nThe highest failure rate is from the Recharge transactions at 5.09%.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT THIS MEANS \u2014 Currently, no bank has a failure rate above 6%. However, we should closely monitor the Recharge transactions as they are the closest to the threshold.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f LIMITATIONS \u2014 This analysis is based on the current dataset of 250,000 UPI transactions.

It's worth investigating further to understand the root cause and address any underlying problems.\n\n\u2753 **FOLLOW-UP:** What are the typical transaction amounts in Uttar Pradesh compared to other states?
