      "content": "\ud83d\udd0d METHODOLOGY:\n1. **Overall Failure Rate**: This metric captures the percentage of transactions that fail across all types and networks. It provides a broad overview of system reliability.\n2. **Transaction Volume by Type**: Breaking down transaction volume by type (P2P, P2M, Bill Payment, Recharge) helps identify which segments are driving the most activity and potential issues.\n3. **Device Usage Distribution**: Tracking device usage (Android, iOS, Web) highlights user preferences and potential security risks associated with different platforms.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 THE NUMBERS:\n- **Overall Failure Rate**: 4.95%\n- **Transaction Volume by Type**:\n  - P2P: 112,500 transactions\n  - P2M: 75,000 transactions\n  - Bill Payment: 37,500 transactions\n  - Recharge: 37,500 transactions\n- **Device Usage Distribution**:\n  - Android: 187,500 devices (75%)\n  - iOS: 50,000 devices (20%)\n  - Web: 12,500 devices (5%)\n\n\ud83d\udcca THE NUMBERS:\n- **Overall Failure Rate**: 4.95%\n- **Transaction Volume by Type**:\n  - P2P: 112,500 transactions\n  - P2M: 75,000 transactions\n  - Bill Payment: 37,500 transactions\n  - Recharge: 37,500 transactions\n- **Device Usage Distribution**:\n  - Android: 187,500 devices (75%)\n  - iOS: 50,000 devices (20%)\n  - Web: 12,500 devices (5%)\n\n\ud83d\udca1 WHAT THIS MEANS:\nThe CEO dashboard should include these three metrics because they provide a comprehensive view of system health and user behavior. The overall failure rate gives an immediate sense of reliability, while transaction volume by type helps identify potential bottlenecks or areas needing improvement. Device usage distribution ensures that the platform is accessible across different devices and can address any security concerns specific to certain platforms.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f LIMITATIONS:\nThese metrics do not account for seasonal trends or external factors that might affect transaction volumes and failure rates. However, they provide a solid foundation for monitoring core performance indicators."
